As part of the ongoing submission, two datasets are available in the present repository. 

- the agent paths (that are not prompt engineering patterns yet)
- the expressions of intent together with the relevant information about the presence and the placement of the personal data and dialog acts (json format)

These sample datasets can be extended and improved if they do interest the community.
