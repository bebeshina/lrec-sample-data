As part of the ongoing submission, two datasets are available in the present repository. 

- **The Agent Graph** : nodes and relationships that are stored in order to be explored using tools such as neo4j. Dialog Act representation corresponding to the Agent turns.
- **The Live Chat Data Sample** : Live Chat conversations: abstract representation of the agent data (dialog acts) and generalized and anonymized visitor data. Each conversation is intent labeled. The intent labels stick to the observations made from the live chat data, they are automatically generated from Live Chat metadata. If necessary, they can be adjusted in order to fit some pre existing intention labeling standard.

These sample datasets can be extended and improved if they do interest the community.
