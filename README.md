As part of the ongoing submission, two datasets are available in the present repository. 

- the Agent Graph (nodes and relationships that are stored in order to be explored using tools such as neo4j)
- a sample data which represents live chat conversations with and abstract representation of the agent data (dialog acts) and generalized and anonymized visitor data as well as the intention label. The intention labels stick to the observations made from the live chat data, tghey are automatically generated from live chat metadata. If necessary, they can be adjusted in order to fit some pre existing intention labeling standard.

These sample datasets can be extended and improved if they do interest the community.
